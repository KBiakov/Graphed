# Graphed
<b>Graphics Editor, May 2012</b>

It is my implementation of graphic editor for DOS graphics mode.

The main features:
<br>1) saving and opening files
<br>2) basic set of tools
<br>3) ability to set the thickness of the brush
<br>4) minimum color palette<br>

This work does not pretend to be the best of the best editors for DOS, but in this case I've tried to achieve the following goals:
<br>a) use the <b>text mode</b> to communicate with the user when working with files
<br>b) <b>buffering</b> the screen when drawing objects
<br>c) waiver of the built-in display graphics and use of the most <b>low-level</b> functions</br>

Of course, there is something to strive for. In particular, the use of constants for common numerical values.
